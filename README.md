**Project Overview:**

In this project, we each chose a statistical metric from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center to determine the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh, combined all of our metrics, and made a final data-driven conclusion on what the "best" neighborhood was, which ended up being Sheraden, based on this so-called combined metric.
